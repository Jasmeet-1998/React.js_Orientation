# Jargons of React JS


****Virtual DOM****

 means only the component that has undergone some change reloads and not the entire web page.

****Props****

 refer to Properties when we want to pass information from 1 component to another component we use props.

****State****

  It is a central place that stores the state of all the components & variables it means the current state and possible states of a variable or components.

  In class based component it was not possible to implement states.
  after introducing hooks it changed the entire game

  ****hooks****
   It is responsible for storing state in the functional component.
   example const [count,setCount]=useState(0);

   in class based component in the constructor ****this (used to refer the instance of the class object)****

   works differently in different languages like java, javascript, ruby on rails.   

****Components****

Class Based and Functional Based component.

# Root

- Every Component we build in React is injected in the root.

- this root can be found in the public directory ---> index.html file of the create-react-app project folder , in this case the basictodo ----> public ----> index.html
